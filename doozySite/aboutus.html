                  “Healthy Vending won’t work,” they said. “The products won’t sell,” they said. “Hospitals, Universities and Colleges will lose revenue,” they said. Sometimes in life, you have to put your headphones on, turn the music up and listen to what your gut is telling you. This was one of those times!” – Founder, Tim Varney
